# blade-element-model

Simplified method for predicting the performance of a propeller. Propellers divided into smaller finite sections. At each section the forces are resolved. This results in a set of non-linear equations solved by iteration for each blade section. The resulting values of section thrust and torque can be summed to predict the overall thrust of the propeller.
